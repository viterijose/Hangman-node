# Hangman-node

CLI hangman game utilizing Objects using Javascript logic for controlling user inputs and determining actions to take. 

## How to play

1. Start the game by running the main file in terminal and typing "node main.js", this will begin script logic.
2. Once the game begins you must answer a few questions, give the game a username and choose a number between 1 and 10. The number is a key for the script to choose a value within in the array and it will be the first pokemon to guess.

3.Now that the number was chosen you can begin guessing the letter you think will fit into the word, if you guess correctly the letter will replace the underscore and you will not loose points, if the guess is repeated you will not loose points but will be asked to choose another letter.

4. Once you guess incorrectly you will start to loose guesses and if you run out of guesses you loose the game. Play the game until you guess all the pokemon starters!
